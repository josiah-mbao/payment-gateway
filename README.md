## üéØ The Vision: Solving Africa's Payment Problem

Juice Coin is a **virtual currency demonstration** of PesaFlow. It's built to showcase how modern, open payment technology can specifically address the pain points of **African Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)**.

### üåç The Challenge
African SMEs lose time and money due to a fragmented financial landscape:

* **High Costs**: Traditional cross-border payments incur **8-15% fees**.
* **Slow Settlement**: Transactions often take **3-5 days** to complete.
* **Lack of Tools**: Developers lack simple, modern APIs to build cross-border features.
* **Fragmentation**: Difficulties in accepting payments across different African countries.

### üí° Our Solution
The Juice Coin Sandbox provides a risk-free environment to interact with a truly modern payment solution:

* **Virtual Economy**: Transact with **Juice Coins (JUC)** to simulate real-world value transfer.
* **Instant Settlement**: Payments are completed in **minutes, not days**, powered by the Interledger Protocol.
* **Developer First**: Access to a full **REST API** for building and testing integrations.
* **Real Technology**: Utilizes the open-source **Rafiki** implementation of ILP.
